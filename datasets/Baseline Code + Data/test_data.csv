I got my order and walked upstairs to the first level and sat at a comfortable booth. Within a few minutes a manager came to my table to ask if everything was OK, and I told him ""Yes"", but I was having trouble to connect to the free WiFi. He immediately helped me with this and although the connection was slow, I was pleased that the problem was solved.

Then the manager chatted with me and asked if I would mind doing a survey and I filled out the online survey. Then he said I was entitled to a free burger so I had a Big Mac.

I think this is a very well managed place and will definitely return when I am back in Manhattan in the Chinatown area.",

Honestly, if you visited every single McDonalds in the country and ranked them I am convinced this one would be dead last.

I spent an hour in the drive-thru and when I got to the window it took 10 minutes before anyone even came to the window and when they did they had no idea what I had ordered.

I have never seen a group of people move so slowly and with such little purpose or interest  in what they were doing. It seems like they were just annoyed to be working at all. Literally it looked like the whole crew was moving in slow motion, it was a sight to see.

Then when I finally did get my food the order it was, of course, not correct. But the weird thing is they didnï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½t short me they gave me an extra quarter pounder and fries.

One of the orders messed up my coffee so bad that it was just a hot coffee with just creamer in it, no sugar or flavor(even though I asked for iced peppermint mocha). I ordered 2 pies and they didn't even give me them, plus picante sauce comes with the breakfast burritos yet they never give me it either. Mess up my McChicken just about every time I order it.

It is a 2 story building that offers specialty cakes, pasta, and custom built pizzas. Also, it has a huge indoor playground for kids as well as the arcade room.

The Food.
We tried pizza and, surprisingly, it was pretty good having in mind it came from the fast food chain. Touch screen menu had enough options of ingredients to customize pizza order based on personal taste. Keep in mind that some toppings cost extra. I would rate pizza 7-8 points out of 10.

From out of town and came through the drive through for some breakfast. The bacon egg and cheese biscuit was so hard it must have been under the warming light for hours!! It was impossible to eat. My sausage mcmuffin was so dry - not at all what I am used to and I order these regularly. After getting to our hotel room (less than 10 minutes from there) and finding out how terrible our breakfast was we called to let the manager know. Not only did she insinuate that we were lying but was less than professional by far. I have not complained to a fast food establishment for over 4 years.

First 2 out of my last 3 breakfast orders were wrong. But didn't realize until I got to work. I cannot leave my job to go back.
Then today I got a steak, egg, and cheese bagel. Which was right with the exception of 2 long black hairs in it.
I stopped back on my way home and asked for a manager.
The first manager only asked for a receipt. She then left and got another manager. She was a heavy set black woman. She was the most ignorant, vile person that I've ever dealt with. Not even an apology. Her response was to bring it back? 5 hours later? When I said that was ridiculous, she closed the window and walked away. I asked for a corporate phone number and she refused.
I called and I can only assume it was the same ignorant woman because she put the phone down and left it off the hook.
I called again for the phone number and she said its on my receipt and hung up.
She is clearly incompetent and doesn't deserve her jib.
Funny thing is I didn't ask for anything free! An I'm sorry may have been enough.
But nothing even close. I would never recommend this dump of a McDonald's nor the clearly racist manager.
I will stop at nothing now to make sure she can't treat anyone like this again",

I was happy there was an option for 24-hr food in case I wanted something on the way home from a night out with friends or just late-night munchies.  During the day, it's a pretty average McD's.  But they lost my business forever when I went by one night at 1am, pulled up to the order box, waited for five minutes, then finally someone came over the speaker and said ""Sorry we're closed"".

Closed?!  It's 24-hrs!  And I get it, sometimes 24-hr places will close one night every several months to do a deep cleaning.  I get that, I really do.  But they ALWAYS post signs and notices so you're not blind-sided by it.  Not this place.  I really don't think they were closed.  I think the workers were too lazy to do their job and decided to shut the store down so they could get paid to do nothing.

Additionally, this store has a bad habit of having a ""broken"" ice cream machine past 10pm.  It's always ""sorry, ice cream machine is broken"" if you come in after the lobby closes.

The worst part is I complained on the website.  I submitted a complaint for this store, pointing out the 24-hr and the ice cream issue.  All I got back (weeks later) was ""oh, sorry the ice cream machine was broken, we're working to upgrade all our locations but it takes time""  Not even a single MENTION of the ""closed"" 24-hr location.

As I said, it's a pretty standard McD's... which is synonymous with lazy, but this one takes the cake on it.",

So I walked inside asking for my order and come to find out that my order was given to someone else! So they had to put my order again through the system so I can get my food so again Now I had to wait for others to come out before mine because my order was last in line.

My issue came with the TWO managers that were ""taking care of the guests"". Zero communication to anyone about what the wait was about.

I stopped into the location on Rt73 in west Berlin NJ  for lunch today. The drive through line was super long so I parked and went I side. I ordered a number 5 (artisan chicken sandwich) meal. I paid, waited like 15 minutes, they called my number and I brought my ticket to the counter and took my bag. I got to work and found out I didn't get a chicken sandwich but instead I got a big mac. Which normally wouldn't be an issue but I hate big macs, I've gotten sick eating one before and ever since I can't even look at a big mac without getting sick to my stomach. Needless to say I wasn't happy. I threw the bag in my car and went on with the rest of my work day... on the way home I stopped back in and brought the bag of food back to McDonald's. The manager named Rebecca came to the counter and I told her what happened and I showed her all of the food I got and explained to her what I was supposed to get.(keep in mind I didn't even touch a fry) She was super rude to me and said she can't do anything because I didn't save my receipt. I don't know about anyone else but I always hand my ticket in when they call my number to prove that it's my food they're handing out. And I asked her what's the difference between a receipt and the untouched food that I brought back? I asked for a refund because I was no longer hungry, she said no, I asked for a new meal, after 5 minutes of her spouting off why she couldn't make it right, she finally gave in and walked away from me huffing and puffing and yelled to the back ""make an artisan chicken sandwich"" so a couple minutes later someone put a bag with just the sandwich in it on the counter and I asked where the fries were and she said, ""there was nothing wrong with the fries earlier, just the sandwich"" so this miserable poop butt of a manager refused to give me fresh French fries with my sandwich and handed me back the old fries from 6 hours ago. She took this whole interaction so personal and was acting like the money was coming out of her pocket. My final argument was asking her if she thought I was lying and did she think I made the big mac and fries at my house and brought it in to pull one over on her? What a horrible experience. It sucks when you get 30 minutes for lunch and you're starving and wind up not being able to eat and it's someone else's fault. You want someone to make it right. Instead this manager who gets to use her little bit of power to make up her own rules and make it difficult for you. Like it would of ruined her entire life to fix their error and make it right. It just sucked, I'll NEVER go back there just because of her. And I hope no one else will either. That's how pissed if this whole mess made me...",

It was probably borderline unsafe for how hot it was for being inside the building. Especially since the kid's playplace was up there.

Where is the quality????? They don't care if people are upset and/or get food poisoning?? Granted my husband should have checked the bag before leaving, but he didn't think to (not surprised). I was definitely upset the order was wrong and said whatever and we were going to eat it because we basically got smaller fries, but an extra sandwich, but those CHEESEBURGERS were so horrendous that whoever put that order together should be fired because it was just wrong..meat and cheese was well past shelf life and the pics I upload will show it.

It apparently is one of the largest in the world and is 3 to 4 stories tall! It has a special menu that is only designed for this McDonald's specifically which makes it extremely unique.. they have made to order pastas and pizzas.. now I went today at 1:15 in the afternoon in order to pizza and I got it within 15 minutes.. but before warned if you go during a busy time it could take up to 45 minutes.. and unfortunately that is the downfall dislocation is on Sand Lake Road which is in a tourism driven area off of International Drive and it is one of the busiest locations you will ever go to.. if you go during one of these peak times it is unbelievable how busy and how disorganized the location can actually be... but when they are firing on all cylinders it can be a fantastic experience... when you get the pieces or the pastas it is absolutely high and restaurant quality... it's literally amazing to go into a McDonald's for god sakes.. and get restaurant quality food of this caliber.. my pizza is Ace stone Brick Oven fired pizza and it is fantastic! And it was only a little over $11 with tax that is wonderful.. if you're ever in the area you should definitely try it ï¿½ï,

New bulding... same substandard food. They must get corporate McDonald leftovers. Not sure why the fries and burgers taste awful compared to other McDs. Cold wilty fries and the hambuger pattes looked worse than most. Hoped the new building would have improved food. Got a green quarter pounder patty last visit in old building.

1. Kiosks are backed up with a bunch of people each so no where to stand, wait, or snake through with trays of food. Kiosks were glitchy and blanked out every minute.
2. It is at least 10 degrees warmer upstairs so NOT comfortable at all.
3. Even with our order number on the table no one ever brought food...after 20 minutes, i went down stairs and it was sitting there. Then there is no drink station upstairs so with an already full tray, i had to bring food up and then come down for drinks. So why did i have to pick a flavor if the only deliver an empty?
4. No one to help with service or questions. Lady upstairs spoke no English. I had to raise my hand at the counter after standing there 5 minutes to find my food just to get acknowledged.
5. After all that, found one sandwich missing. Went back again and notified i was missing the cheese steak and staff member walked to the other pasta section where it was sitting by itself.
6. Cheeseburgers were not made to order as requested on the kiosk.
7. Big mac was dry. Worst one ever.

We won't be back.",

Waited 30 minutes for my first (and very probably last) spicy chicken sandwich (photo attached). You'd think with taking that amout of time it would at least resemble the menu picture in some small way, but no.
They ALMOST managed to get some sauce in there. Slightly more would have helped disguise the taste of the burnt brioche bun! I ate it for 3 reasons 1) I was hungry 2) I didn't want to wait a further 30 minutes to be served up another sad, burnt offering and 3) the dead eyes of the staff threatened to haunt my dreams for all eternity and I just couldn't face the soulsucking experience of trying to explain my disappointment to them when they were all clearly in their own personal hells.
Take my advice, if you decide to run the gauntlet of a late evening visit to this restaurant, order the pasta, not a burger, it's pretty decent if you have at least 30 minutes to wait for it. Otherwise, do yourself a favour and wander on to one of the many other restaurant choices in this part of iDrive. Wish I had!",

This is like 300IQ so get ready. You get a piece of paper and write something to the effect of ""drive thru closed"" and tape it to the drive thru speakerbox. This will effectively let everyone except blind drivers know that no one in the store will be taking your order.

I only go here when I see they are not busy, in hope that my order is correct when I go to leave. In the 10 times that I have been here in the past past year, I have only had 1 order that was perfectly correct. Just ONE, not an exaggeration. That one order was just 2 large fries and nothing else. Though I will mention that when I got home and pulled them out of the bag, they were hardly what you'd call filled, (nor did I enjoy any on the 3 minute drive home) so little so that I even sent a picture and post to McDonald's on Facebook, at least the few were hot. The evening staff is very pleasant, but the morning staff leaves a lot to be desired, as well as thinking that they can talk negatively about people in Spanish out in the open which, being a light skinned Puerto Rican, I understand perfectly.

So all they did was note NO Bacon, and still charged me the full price for a Bacon Mcdouble. When I got to the window I clarified again, but was told they didn't have that in their system, and that I had to pay the full price for the Bacon Mcdouble. I asked ro talk to the manager who then told me they didn't have what I ordered. I told him to go out and check his menu, because it was on there. He told me he didn't need to, that it was not on the menu. He was very rude and dismissive. I realize it is just a few cents difference, but why should anyone pay for something they didn't order, especially if what you ordered is on the menu. I see no reason to be treated so unprofessionally, and rudely. I don't recommend visiting this McDonalds, luckily there are plenty of others near by who treat people with respect.",

I parked, called, told them I had an order and they said to get in the drive thru. By the time I got to the window; they hadn't even started the order. It took 20 minutes in total. I lost money waiting on McDonald's.

Cashier was slow, did not ring up my order  correctly, had on gloves and was touching his hat, money, pulled his phone out of his pocket several times and was handling food.... this is not sanitary! Not happy at the fact that we waited for 15 minutes for 3 large fries as we watched the drive thru serve 8 other orders before ours, and we were the only customers inside at the time.... Having worked for mcdonalds in the past, I know for a FACT it takes just a little over 2 minutes to fry a full basket of fries (which leads 3 large fries). And if they had 3 baskets down at once (which they did) then there should be no reason to have had us wait for so long. Will not return to this location!",

With that said, the fact that they force you to utilize the kiosk must me some kind of self sabotage. If people are willing to pay at the counter then it could drive down demand for the kiosk.

Secondly; there is a heavyset woman with glasses that gets mad and angry when customers ask for stuff and has to forward it to the manager every time yelling loud enough for rhe lobby; not to mention she hovers over the lobby while people are eating (i get that you want to catch mess early or clean the tables quick I have worked food service before) but do not hover around people trying to eat like some kind of table patrol.

But they didn't cook my quarter pounder to temp because it was still red on the inside of the meat which was disgusting. I had to go to the door in order to get my burger fixed which then I ran into the situation of them starting to close their doors 5 minutes before they were supposed to close at 12 and the employee looked at me and said we are closed when I literally was holding the burger in my hand to show for proof. I look at the employee and say I know I came up here because I had just ordered from the drive thru this burger and it isn't cooked all the way. She takes the burger doesn't say anything and shuts the door with me standing outside. I then wait thank gosh she came back with a new one I didn't know if she was going to. I didn't get an apology though for my burger not being cooked all the way through though.,

The chicken sandwich was not hot either  and worse , it was waaaay overly smeared  with unhealthy  mayo which  I threw away so as to not suffer food poisoning.

This visit was probably the worst I've experienced. I ordered my food at 9:11AM - A mcgriddle, a coffee, and two hashbrowns. Once I paid I was immediately told to go to #1, so I did. After waiting until 9:30AM with no one in the drive thru line anymore I went back around where a female with red hair came walking out with a guy who looked like they knew each other. After handing me my bag, I asked about my drink and she said ""What drink"", I said the coffee that's listed on the ticket you provided me along with the receipt. She said okay and then CONTINUED to hold a conversation with the guy standing right in front of me. I waited an additional 2 minutes and she was still talking and laughing with the guy while me, a customer was watching her and patiently waiting for my coffee. Needless to say, my patience went thin and I told her to forget about it and I had to leave. I paid for something I never received and was treated with the most disrespect in my book.

They close off most of the dining room. One time, I went in to order something around 1 am, but was unable to find any seating because other people were on their laptop hogging the booths and not ordering anything. They were taking up space. Mcdonalds staff did nothing about it when we complained about there being no seating. Most Mcdonalds offers free refills on medium and large drinks, but not this one. One time I asked the manager for a free refill and he was very rude and dismissive. This is not an ideal place to dine in at all, but it is still convenient to order a coffee there though.",

Number of times they've gotten the order right: 0

It cannot be spelled out any clearer. ""Quarter pounder. Absolutely nothing on it. No cheese. Just the meat and the bun."" It is so simple. Under normal circumstances I would stick around for them to get it right. But they have a steady supply of drugged out homeless people begging for money right there in the drive through line, so running that gauntlet a second time is downright dangerous.

So I get home to see if i can salvage this order. Pull the bun all the way off to start scraping fake cheese off of it. The stale, burned bun breaks (picture). I successfully scrape the cheese product off the top only to find there's another slice of fake cheese underneath the patty as well.

For kids that ""must"" play a game, there are 2 dining tables with touchscreens!

There's plenty of seating (both upstairs and on the main floor) and clean bathrooms on both levels.

I expected a 30 foot statue of Ronald McDonald and it ended up being a lackluster 30 foot lighted outline of Ronald on the building.  The picture online of the building made it look like it was made of a French Fry building structure.  It wasn't.  They had a separate drink station where you gave them your drink order (an extra step because no self service ones anywhere).  They had a separate dessert station, and a walk up food counter to order or self-serve kiosks to order from, where they will serve if you eat in (but not the soft drinks).  It is 2 stories.  The 2nd floor is a play area which I expected would be huge (it isn't), and a small arcade area...very small.  The menu showed some items different from other McDonald's but 95% of them showed OUT OF STOCK. So we just ate the kind of food you could eat at a regular McDonald's only it cost MUCH more!

The customer service is highly lacking and I'm positive the management of that location is damaging your brand. Not only is service extremely slow but the drive through service provider and the manager is horrible. We literally witnessed people driving away from the intercom after waiting and waiting with no response. We drove up to the intercom and waited and waited. Zero response. We spoke multiple times. No reaponse. No one greeted us. No one asked us to wait. Nothing. Radio silence. Then we dro e up to window only to face a combative manager with a chip on his shoulder. Needless to say we drove away without making an order. It was an experience that definitely does not live up to the world renowned brand standards of McDonald's.,

When you order at a kiosk, you can order things they do not have such as a waffle cone ice cream.  Then you wait 15+ minutes to find out they don't have waffle cones and wait for an employee to make a fresh one, which she doesn't know how to do so you end up paying $4+ for a cup of ice cream.

The employee (manager) handling the front end was the rudest individual I've ever met of all my visits to McDonald's in my 30 years. Her attitude got her confronted by several of the customers waiting for food. One lady said she'd been waiting on her food for over an hour. They wouldn't even accommodate her with a refund. Infact my order $25 took 40 min to fill. The store shut down the kiosks, as well as the drive through window to attempt to fill orders of those waiting in the lobby. I understand it's easy to get overwhelmed but when you're filling orders for customers that have just ordered while you have customers that have been waiting on food for nearly an hour, your prioritizing methods are failing. And combining that with the attitude of the manager on duty at the time will result in a lot of unhappy customers. I'm on vacation and will most likely never be in this restaurant again. But if I were a local, they would have just received their last $25 from my pocket. My recommendation on would be to avoid the smaller McDonald's in down town orlando, the management  lacks in people skills and the whole establishment functions as a team poorly. The girl running the fries and the font end had better people skills and prioritized better than either member of management on duty.

Not good, new construction is nice. But understaffed. Even at 2-3am you can walk in and find over half of the tables covered with trays and garbage. Also the floors heavily littered. Yes you are supposed to buss your own table at a fast food restaurant, but alot of foreign/domestic vacationers are just filthy. They just drop food and wrappers everywhere. When they are done eating they just get up and leave.
Host/busser is needed for the dining area for the sloppy pigs. More register coverage for the guests. When a crowd of people have to go through one register while the kitchen staff waits for orders is inefficient.
I have had 2-3 errors in my 8 visits. First one was when they put extra mustard on burger instead of adding mayo. Second was they ran out of hot fudge and instead of telling me they used the coffee chocolate topping for my Sunday's (yes 2 of them).
I caught the first error quickly and was easily fixed properly by management before I left. The 2nd error wasn't caught till we where eating the Sunday's at home. I took one back as proof of the error to get a refund. At first they only wanted to refund one but with several minutes of bickering they refunded both. Yeah it was only $1 and some change but it was the principal.
I walk to and from the restaurant since I have no car it is about one mile away from my home. I always request 2 plastic bag's for my food because the one paper bag they put my 6-8 burgers fails halfway home. The 2nd one is for the 3 Sunday's.

Another epic failure, ordered 2 mcdouble no mustard and onions. 2 bacon mcdouble  and 2 mcdouble regular. Received the 2 mcdouble wo/mustard and onions no problem. 2 bacon mcdouble had no bacon and no mustard fail. 2 regular mcdouble had no mustard either fail. 2 large fries ordered and received 2 medium sized fries and 2 of the smallest sized fries I've ever seen (guess they where kids sized) fail. The 20 peice fry came without incident. Less than 1/2 of the whole order came correctly....

While on a long road trip we stopped in to get gas and coffee. Upon entering the McDonald's the floors were extremely dirty, but we came after lunch so maybe they had a busy lunch rush. Then when I stepped up to the counter to order, the menu screens were stuck on frozen 2 advertisements. Then I order 2 Caramel Mocha  Coffees. After about 3min of waiting the kid behind the counter tells me the machine broke he needs to get the manager. Come to find out the machine is on auto-clean and it will be 18min before our coffee is ready. Not wanting to wait around they tell me they can give me two regular coffees. When I tell them that regular coffee is 1$ a cup and I was charged 7.58$ for two specialty coffees they offer to make up the difference in food. That's nice and all, but we did not want nor need any food. I ask for just a refund at that point. Mind you this whole ordeal takes almost the 18min for the machine to finish cleaning but by now I just wanted to get out of there. The staff were all very young and seemed very poorly trained. While they were nice and tried to make it right, I think better training of the employees at this location is necessary.

The grease from the burger had absorbed into the bread so much that I squeezed the bread and grease dripped from it. The frys were not at all fresh. I threw my meal in the trash where it belonged. Called the store and spoke with John. He apologized and took my name down and I will get a refund but it doesnt help my hunger NOW. Worst encounter with McDonalds ever.

Dining room was small, seemed clean (my order was to-go so didn't spend much time inside).

Loved the digital menu/self-order kiosks (ordered at the kiosk and it still gave the option to pay cash at the register, though not sure if that option's still available and/or if the dining room's even open right now...?).

Staff was friendly enough and very helpful, packed my to-go order like absolute pros.

The area where the fountain drinks, straws, etc., are wasn't super tidy (a bit of a spill on the countertop, if memory serves); however, seemed clean, otherwise.

Because it was such a quick trip, didn't get to see the condition of the bathrooms (a good indicator of an establishment's working and overall conditions, in my experience). Maybe another time?

Overall, a good experience.

Something to consider: there's no drive-through nor a parking lot and finding a parking space seems to be a nightmare/hit-or-miss in that area. Circled the surrounding blocks a few times before someone parked almost right in front of the store just happened to be leaving (not sure how often that happens, though). Score!

The previous parking spot I'd found was about 2 blocks away (doable), but kept searching in order to be closer to the other establishment my group and I were visiting prior to McD's.",

An employee Nlnamed TJ brought our food to our table. I noticed I didn't have the apple chunks and raisins that come with the oatmeal. I let her know she went back and brought me what I needed.

I then noticed the hash brown I ordered wasn't on the tray either.
I let her know and she apologized, then comes back with not one but 2 hash browns, which oddly enough my young child decided after we got our food that she did want a hashbrown now. She comped a free hashbrown.
She was such a pleasant person to deal with.  Her customer service and customer care abilities are 20/10

I over heard he saying to another customer that this location isn't her usual location and she is a General Manager.

She took care of evryone around us, with an amazing attitude and a smile on her face, which is a rare occasion.

I hope she gets the recognition she deserves, and a promotion or raise. She turned a typically frustrating situation and made it a pleasant one. It's funny to think that I we left happy even though our order was messed up.",

The last person walked around like a zombie who had no idea what planet they were even on.  He would pick up a bag occasionally and put it back down and the clear orders from the system and not give anything to the customers. Then when customers complained he would ask them what they ordered and the try to find food for the. After seeing that 3 customers who ordered 20+ minutes after me and my friends I asked to speak with the manager. He proceeded to lie and said that once and order has been on for a while the automatic delete off the que.  So he had no idea what any of us ordered.

It is very upsetting!  Also, we tend to order a lot of unsweetened ice teas.  8 out of 10 times the tea tastes disgusting!!  It is old tea or the bag doesn't get changed when the make more.  I get so mad that no one seems to care enough to be sure every shift cares to do their job correctly to ensure a high quality in ALL their products.  I have brought these concerns to numerous managers and employees but never get satisfaction that they care and fix the issue!!  It may be ok for a week but happens again or on a different shift.  All emplyees should care enough about their jobs and themselves to do the best they can in all areas of a job performance!!!

And yes, you guessed it, a third pink burger!!!!!! So at this point of course I am very much disgusted and appalled by their lack attentiveness of the food they are distributing to the point I ask another customer next to me if he had seen what I did....

They were closed for several months due to construction. The great food and service has made up for the time when they were not operational. The food is always hot and the Buns so far have been fresh and soft. The best thing about McDonald's are the FRIES!!!!  Their fries are always fresh, hot, and delicious. The best part is they stand straight up in the box just as they do on the commercials and pictures. I don't mind waiting in the sometimes long drive-thru line for fresh food. Thank you for having pride in the food you serve.",

This is true for this particular restaurant, however, it seems that being soooo busy (I guess excellent location) makes them impervious to concerns about customer service or satisfaction of their customers.

Running out of lettuce, running out ""of many things"", are management/logistics problems. Bad attitude, lack of courtesy, well I guess that problem is on us, the customers, right?

The two stars are for do providing the best breakfast sandwich in the market still, regardless of attitude and bad manners.",

Really love the clean store, the big mac is delicious and so are the breakfast items and chicken nuggets. The convention is right here so there are a lot of tourists but they have a self serve kiosk that helps to speed up taking orders. Highly recommend this store if you're in the area. The service is nice and there are plenty of places to sit down to eat. Be careful leaving the parking lot though as international drive (the road) is pretty interesting at times. In conclusion, I rate this McDonald's 5/5 and I hope to be back soon to take out more food to do mukbangs.",

I told them I tried it and was unable to complete the order and I prefer (wanted) to do it thru cashier. Manager Jennifer was rude and said that if I wanted to do it with a cashier I had to do it via drive thru. To be honest, that is totally disrespectful and unprofessional. Where is the customer service or Customer Service satisfaction?? You can not force your customers to do only kiosk!!!! What about people that can't read???
